## Description

A yummy delicious theme to make your Logseq a more rich experience.

**Tasks**: Use a fairly faint blue accent color to draw the user's attention, but provide a certain lightness level so that it's not over empowering.

**Breadcrumbs**: Use a smaller font-size, and reduction in brightness of the font-color so that you can focus on the important stuff, your notes.

![breadcrumbs](assets/breadcrumbs.gif)

**Page References and tags**: Use a rich color that helps draw your attention, but is not overly flashy, and uses a complementary color that fits the main colors so that it's not over empowering.
